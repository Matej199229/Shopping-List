## Shopping List App

This is a simple JavaScript-powered shopping list application that allows users to add, edit, delete, and filter items. Items are stored in localStorage, so the list persists across page reloads. The app demonstrates key JavaScript concepts including working with the DOM, adding event listeners (submit, click, input, DOMContentLoaded), manipulating HTML elements dynamically, and interacting with localStorage. It also includes features like input validation, real-time filtering, edit mode toggling, and duplicate item prevention (case-insensitive and across both DOM and storage). The code structure is modular and highlights reusable utility functions, conditionals, and array methods such as .forEach(), .some(), and .filter().
